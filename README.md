Each day, you can either buy one share of WOT, sell any number of shares of WOT that you own or not make any transaction at all. What is the maximum profit you can obtain with an optimum trading strategy?

## [2. Java Stack](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/java-stack)
A string containing only parentheses is balanced if the following is true: 1. if it is an empty string 2. if A and B are correct, AB is correct, 3. if A is correct, (A) and {A} and [A] are also correct.

## [3. Self Balancing Tree](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/self-balancing-tree)
You are given a pointer to the root of an AVL tree. You need to insert a value into this tree and perform the necessary rotations to ensure that it remains balanced.

## [4. Dijkstra: Shortest Reach 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/dijkstrashortreach)
It is required to calculate the shortest distance from the start position (Node S) to all of the other nodes in the graph.

## [5. Quicksort In-Place](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/quicksort3)
Create an in-place version of Quicksort. You need to follow Lomuto Partitioning(https://www.hackerrank.com/external_redirect?to=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort#Algorithm) method.

## [6. Dijkstra: Shortest Reach 2](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/dijkstrashortreach)
It is required to calculate the shortest distance from the start position (Node S) to all of the other nodes in the graph.
